      <p>Adventurers are people that fight monsters mainly for rewards. Everyone can become a adventure. Only after passing the test. There are mostly 2 to 3 parts in this test (based on what the writer of that story wishes to do). The main parts of the test would be a theoretical test and a practical one. After someone passes a test they will need to measure their manapool (to determine how much mana that person has). This part could also be a part of the tests. after that they will get a rank. Every beginner adventurer will start by the lowest rank, That will in most cases be F or E. They will need to complete quest that are found on a quest board. Most beginner mission are to gather herbs or fight a few monsters like goblins or rabbits. If they think that they are ready to take the rank-up quest then they will need to do a quest that is a common one for that rank. The ranks go from F - E - D - C - B - A - S. They can also be ranked with metal types like iron, gold or diamond. Monsters are also ranked in this order, but they have 2 more ranks above S. These are SS and SSS. 
      What determines a monster is the danger and destruction they can cause on their own so this is completely different from how adventurers are ranked. The adventurers has 1 thing that is different from monsters and that is class. Not the status they have but their job. Each adventurer has their own class/job they fulfill on the battelfield or hunt. The basic classes are swordsmen, mage, shielder, archer and cleric/priest. Each one of these classes have their own role to fulfill. Like the shielder takes the attacks of the monsters to protect his team. The archer checks the status of the battlefield and takes care of the enemies that are in the back ad supports the forward units. The mage supports the forward units to give them a opening to attack. And the cleric/priest heals his teams to survive or give them buffs to strengthen them. These are just the basic ones. There are a lot more that are more advanced and detailed with their rolls.</p>
