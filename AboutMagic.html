        <p class="item-tekst">Magic is used for all sort of things. But of course there are all sorts of magic. All the magic sorts are offensive, defensive and support. These are the basis but of course there are different types and sorts of magic for example black magic or arcane magic or wide-range or close-range. Offensive magic is used for attacking. The defensive magic is used for defending like a barrier. And the support magic is used for buffing your teamates or healing them. </p>
      <p>magic is manifesting something into the world useing mana. There are 4 levels for magic activation. First assimilation, second mental image, third construction and last but not least manifestation. Assimilation is where you learn the principles of natural phenomenons. Mental image is where you visualize what you determine what it is that you want to manifest in the mind. Construction is to construct the formulas in order to manifest he visual image. And manifestation is where the magic cmes to exist in the world through the formula. Assimilation, construction and manifestation can be learned as long as you put enough time and efforts inn to studying it. But mental image is different, the mental image is not something that you can reach through sheer efforts. However if you break out of your limits and reach a freedom of imagination through courage can your mental image improve.

      There are also multiple ways to use magic. People can use just there hands and chanting to use it. Or one can use a staff or stick to make the process easier. These methods are all just to increase the speed of manifesting magic but there is a way to use magic at the highest speed. That is chantless magic. Chantless magic is as the name suggest magic without chanting. So that means just sticking you hand out and skip the whole chant process. Although this will decrease the damage output it will increase the manifestation speed. For non-mages to use magic is by enchanting their  weapons. You can enchant a weapon by engraving it with a magic circle or ancient text/runes. These weapon can use magic spells regardless if the user has mana.</p>
