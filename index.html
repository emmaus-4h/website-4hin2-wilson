           Magicicinas are known to be able to cause supernatural phenomenas, be it in the world of fiction or the real world. In the real world there would be no real magic. They are just tricks that they use to perform their show. Although they are hard to understand from time to time. In the world of fiction, there where the real magic exist, is completely different from the magic in our world. Their magic is like mathematics or physics in our world . They need to understand the concept of it and the formula in order to even use the basics of magic. For them to get the magic to manifest they need a special energy source, that energy source is called mana. Everyone is born with mana according to their world some differ from each other like the the amount of mana or the quality. The amount of mana is called the mana pool, some people are born with large amount of it and some may have so little mana that it's unnoticeble.</a>
